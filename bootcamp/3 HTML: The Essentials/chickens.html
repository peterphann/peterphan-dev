    The <b>chicken</b> (<b><i>Gallus domesticus</i></b>) is a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a>
    species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
    Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
    Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may
    be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a
    sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
    their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in
    some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
    numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.

    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
    Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
    subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in
    the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and
    Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th
    century BC.[7][8]

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster, and an adult female is called a hen.</p>

  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
    as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used
    throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]</p>

  <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
  <p>
    Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
    animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]
  </p>
  <p>
    The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken lived for
    16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]
  </p>
  <p>
    Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny, pointed
    feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of
    females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
    pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the comb, or
    eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and
    female chicks may be differentiated by colour).
  </p>
  <p>
    Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either
    side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are
    called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds, these are more
    prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds that causes extra feathering
    under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]
  </p>
  <p>
    Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying
    for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally
    fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
